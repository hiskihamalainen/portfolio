Instructions: 

Six (6) cards are dealt to each player. On each turn, one card
turns around from a card pyramid. If a player has one or more 
cards of the same value in his hand, he may give a chug to 
his opponents. The number chugs given is shown on the text 
field. The game is played until every card in the pyramid is turned 
around. The player with the most cards left “wins” the round and becomes 
the bus driver. 

In case of a tie: 

If the game ends in a tie between two or more players, the "winner" 
will be drawn as instructed. Remaining cards from players remain in 
their hands, the rest is mixed into the deck. If the player has
a card with same value as drawn from a deck of cards, he can turn his 
own card upside down. "Winner" is the player who has the most cards left
in their hand after turning the card. Players will continue drawing cards 
from the deck until there is no unambiguous “winner”. The player with the 
most cards left becomes the bus driver. If no "winner" can be decided this way,
the game chooses a random winner.
 
Bus driver: 

The pyramid is reassembled. The bus driver turns one card from each row until 
a picture card is revealed. If a picture card is revealed, the bus driver 
has to take the shown amount of chugs and start the round again from the start. 
The player gets out of the role of the bus driver when he gets to the top of the 
pyramid without hitting a picture card. Players can then start the round from 
the beginning.
